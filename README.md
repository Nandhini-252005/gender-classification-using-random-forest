# Gender Classification using Random Forest

This project implements a **Gender Classification** system using the **Random Forest** machine learning algorithm. The model is developed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and is intended for educational and academic purposes.

## Project Overview

Gender classification is a common supervised machine learning task where a model predicts gender based on given features.  
In this project, a **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on a dataset containing relevant attributes to accurately classify gender.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow:
- Data loading
- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
